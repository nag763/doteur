## About this tool

Doteur is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that has for purpose to render the SQL schemas into good looking graphs. This will help you to easily understand the structure of a large database and understand what happens behind the scenes of your project.


Besides, you will be able to use the large panel of features to either sort the tables you want to visualize or render with a different color scheme for instance.

So far the tool handles both the MySQL and SQLite syntaxes, but it is planned to handle the Postgre one as soon as the formers will be considered as stable. The input of the tool can be either a sql file export, or given the version you downloaded, connect to either a MySQL running instance or an existing SQLite database. 

The tool has been developed on Linux, but is also available for Windows 10 and 11 and macOS.
